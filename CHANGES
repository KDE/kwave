 * bugfix: selected resolution takes effect
 * bugfix: caption of main window changes after "SaveAs"
 * bugfix: SignalManager::writeWavChunk now doesn't destroy the signal's
   data while saving
 * make distclean in the projekt root directory also removes zero-length
   files, *.orig, *.rej and *~ (just makes cleaner than before)
 * symbolic links to Makefile, Makefile.in and Makefile.am in the plugins
   directory are deleted with "make distclean" and rebuilt on "make"
   (changes in the referenced Makefiles in the template directory will not
   be reflected thousand times when creating a patch with diff)
 * cleanups, removed some old backup files
 * improved support for debugging accessible through
 * "configure --enable-debug=yes" (-g and -DDEBUG compiler flags)
 * rewritten big parts of Makefile.in for the plugins
 * added -O2 compiler optimization

1999-12-03 (by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de)

 * merged with Martin Wilz's version

1999-11

 * version numbering script donated by Thomas Eschenbacher
 * now using KTMainwindow for top level widgets
 * using timer to check message port -> alternative (threadsafe) message
   passing instead of signal/slot
 * labelling code rewritten, now incompatible with old releases
 * batch loading routines

1999-10

 * deleting channels works again
 * fixed savelabel dialog
 * corrected envelope dialog, string handling
 * connected many functions via the new string-based way of invocation
 * fixed some dependencies between old code and new classes
   (there's still more to do !)
 * saving should now work again
 * trimmed down Clipboard class
 * Color class as wrapper to QColor (may become independent later)
 * reworking Curve Class for creation via string, interpolation now
   uses curve objects
 * moved gui functions into a new library (libkwavegui)
 * new Classes: Parser DynamicLoader Filter (prevously was a struct)
 * moved gui-independent functions into a library (libkwave)
 * rework of dialogs into single files and single plugins
 * new calling scheme via string commands. This will allow scripting and macro
   definitions. Threading is made a whole lot easier, because a only a
   string has to be passed and gets expanded into the needed set of
   parameters in each thread
 * io functions and playback adapted to SignalManager
 * Introduction of SignalManager class for multiple channel management

0.29.5 [1998-04]

 * Just a fix for an annoying bug while zooming out

0.29.4 [1998-03]

 * removed a memory leak in playback
 * triple-checked the missing Accelerators in the Menumanager. It seems to
   be a bug in qpopmenu, I'll wait for qt to be fixed, or until a workaround
   is known
 * recent Files are updated again, while the program is running
 * kwave now keeps track of last directory saved to; for user convenience
 * reestablished selection mechanism to match versions
   before 0.29.3 and corrected some otherwise screwed-up behaviour
 * _now_ all parameters to destructors should have vanished

0.29.3 [1998-02]

 * developement has slowed down a bit, this release is not as complete as I
   wished but since 0.29.2 has a destructor with parameters accidently left
   in, and so does not compile on all systems -> here we go again...

 * reworked selection routines into a new class, code is still rather
   confusing, but seems to work
 * added checkmark functionality again
 * converted file-menus to new menu-scheme
 * added gui to mix channels together, the needed functions for mixing
   are still missing
 * Halt button by Gerhard Zintel

0.29.2

 * moved clipboard functionality to its own class
 * dynamic allocation of menu entries used by all classes but TopWidget
 * import of ascii data files

0.29.1

 * Bugfix for multichannel save. Now the saved files should work with other prgs
 * local snap to peak by Gerhard Zintel

0.29.0

 * changed version numbering and filename as suggested by
   Version 1.1 of "How To Name Things" from sunsite. The last digit will
   always mark be 0 for releases uploaded to ftp.kde.org.
 * added windowing (Hamming Hanning, Blackmann) functions
 * contribution from Gerhard Zintel displaying notes in fftview
 * Added pitch display window
 * implemented cursor and db scale for fft-view
 * added reselection and cursor change
 * added possibility of different display modes in Frequency representation
 * fixed severe quantisation bug in saving 16Bit routine, reported by ?
 * mmaping support contributed by Juhana Kouhia
 * added as new Possibility to generate Signals: pulse trains
 * added wrapper for systems with no posixthreads ->
   still needs handling by configure script
   (change Makefile for not linking libpthread and doing a define)
 * First use of multiple threads (pthreads) in some functions
 * Pitch generation now independent of additive synthesis
 * added import function for ascii files
 * Ascii label saving now also by frequency
 * Label generation according to Period Detection (autocorellation)
 * Sonagram, FFTView and Distortion-Dialog  now use ScaleWidgets
 * New ScaleWidget gives the user more information
 * Improved ProgressDialog and Interpolation class to allow multiple threads
 * fixed some minor bugs

0.28 [1998-07-15]

 * changes in curvewidget (recent point has another pixmap).
 * sorting of labels now works without overwriting of QGList::compareItems.
 * bug fix for saving selection.
 * save Block function added.
 * signal finding function in markers.cpp: gui improved.
 * some smaller bug fixes.

0.27

 * first release, but never uploaded, because ftp.kde.org was down.
