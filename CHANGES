0.5.5 [2000-12-01]

 * new playback handling, allows pause/continue

   shows a message and truncates the input at the end of the file
 * found out that we need ALSA support for 24 and 32 bits/sample

   -> thanks to ParaSoft Corporation for making this limited version of
      the tool available (http://www.parasoft.com)
 * SignalWidget uses three layers for drawing, speeds up the redraws
   after mouse selection by about factor 14(!!!) on my system :-))

0.5.2-10 [2000-05-21]

 * some minor bugfixes in the Makefiles
 * save the kwave.spec and include it into the source archive, this
   lets "rpm -ta kwave-x.x.x-x.tar.gz" work
 * wrote a new README file, moved Martin's version to README.OLD

     until they reach a TopWidget
   - the TopWidget (highest level) dispatches the comands and forwards
     them to the lower levels

0.5.2 [2000-04-24]

   without any previous installation of kwave

 * bugfix in plugins/template/Makefile.am: will not create .moc files on
   make distclean and other targets

   files, *.orig, *.rej and *~ (just makes cleaner than before)

   parameters in each thread
 * io functions and playback adapted to SignalManager
 * Introduction of SignalManager class for multiple channel management

0.29.5 [1998-12-25] (by Martin Wilz <mwilz@ernie.mi.uni-koeln.de>)

 * developement has slowed down a bit, this release is not as complete as I
   wished but since 0.29.2 has a destructor with parameters accidently left
   in, and so does not compile on all systems -> here we go again...

 * reworked selection routines into a new class, code is still rather
   confusing, but seems to work
 * added checkmark functionality again
 * converted file-menus to new menu-scheme
 * added gui to mix channels together, the needed functions for mixing

   still needs handling by configure script
   (change Makefile for not linking libpthread and doing a define)
 * First use of multiple threads (pthreads) in some functions
 * Pitch generation now independent of additive synthesis
 * added import function for ascii files
 * Ascii label saving now also by frequency
 * Label generation according to Period Detection (autocorellation)
