0.5.5 [2000-12-01]

 * new playback handling, allows pause/continue
 * limited the playback buffer to be between 256 and 65536 bytes

 * changed some header lines in this file
 * started on writing a new documentation / online help using docbook

0.5.3 [2000-06-12]

 * if a file with invalid size (e.g. recorded by "arecord") is loaded,
   shows a message and truncates the input at the end of the file
 * found out that we need ALSA support for 24 and 32 bits/sample
 * >>> playback in stereo <<<
 * selected channels (x) are mixed to the output device's channels (y)
   at playback using a x:y translation matrix with linear scaling, all
   values for x and y except zero are allowed

   still to be done, currently only mono)
 * fixed many memory leaks and inconsistent delete operations (e.g. used
   "delete" instead of "delete[]")
 * included support for (and tested with) the error detection and memory 
   debugging tool "Insure++ Lite 4.1" (./configure --enable-insure=yes ...)
   -> thanks to ParaSoft Corporation for making this limited version of
      the tool available (http://www.parasoft.com)
 * SignalWidget uses three layers for drawing, speeds up the redraws
   after mouse selection by about factor 14(!!!) on my system :-))

0.5.2-10 [2000-05-21]

 * some minor bugfixes in the Makefiles
 * save the kwave.spec and include it into the source archive, this
   lets "rpm -ta kwave-x.x.x-x.tar.gz" work
 * wrote a new README file, moved Martin's version to README.OLD
 * RPM_OPT_FLAGS are appended to the compiler options, this lets
   pentium optimizations work :-)
 * shows a message box if loading of a file failed

0.5.2-9 [2000-05-19]

 * handling of channel add/delete: selection/speakers are shifted
 * changed some variables/parameters to "unsigned" (simplifies range checks)
 * beautified this file
 * beautified the whole source code according to my favorite coding style.
   -> thanks to the developers of the "Artistic Style" package,
      astyle-1.11.4-1 made good work :-)
 * fixed that annoying flicker in the help/about dialog
 * checking for sizes of char, short and int at configure time
 * >>> COMPLETE REWORK OF THE INTERNAL COMMAND STRUCTURE <<<
   - made use of a combination of signals/slots and string messages
   - hierarchical processing: commands are are forwarded "upwards"
     until they reach a TopWidget
   - the TopWidget (highest level) dispatches the comands and forwards 
     them to the lower levels
 * globals.app will not be used (obsolete, should be removed from libkwave)
 * MessagePort will not be used (obsolete, should be removed from libkwave)
 * multiple toplevel windows are possible

 * rpm package should now be installable without conflicts and compile
   without any previous installation of kwave
 * removed the "${KDEDIR}/share/doc/HTML/default" directory from the rpm
   so that it doesn't conflict with the already existing one

   up to the start/end of the signal
 * bugfix in display of signal: signal is no longer inverted
 * selectrange() works now
 * the zoom factor combo box reflects the current "real" zoom factor
 * some bugfixes in menu handling / cleanups
 * complete rework of zoom and offset handling:
   - simple poly-lines instead of lowpass interpolation if zoom factor
     has less than 10 pixels per sample
   - lowpass interpolation if more than 10 pixels per sample
 * bugfix in KWaveApp: now sets globals.app to this if it was null before, 
   now doesn't crash if it loads a file specified at cmdline

0.5.1-4

 * >>> now compiles and runns under RedHat 6.1 / Halloween IV <<<
   >>> as well as under SuSE 6.2                              <<<
 * version info of libkwavegui.so is set to the package's version
 * bugfix in plugins/template/Makefile.am: will not create .moc files on
   make distclean and other targets
 * compiler flags are passed through to plugin compilation
 * compiling with --no-rtti. This was necessary to compile against the
   kde libraries of RedHat that seem to contain no rtti. As a side effect
   all warnings on linking programs/libs disappeared :-)

   were lost during Martin's changes
 * changed shortcut for mixpaste from CTRL-SHIFT-X to CTRL-SHIFT-C
 * added the "crop" command to the edit menu
 * made the "mixpaste" command work

 * one class per file is now the standard
 * stripped leading "Kwave" in Classnames for most Classes

 * fixed a nasty bug in SignalManager::save that caused crashes on
   several positions in the program and libstdc++

 * gave the destructor of SignalManager some code, this fixes
   a huge memory leak !

 * SignalManager::writeWavChunk uses buffers for writing (much faster!)
 * bugfix: caption of main window changes after "SaveAs"
 * bugfix: selected resolution takes effect

   files, *.orig, *.rej and *~ (just makes cleaner than before)
 * symbolic links to Makefile, Makefile.in and Makefile.am in the plugins
   directory are deleted with "make distclean" and rebuilt on "make"
   (changes in the referenced Makefiles in the template directory will not
   be reflected thousand times when creating a patch with diff)
 * cleanups, removed some old backup files
 * improved support for debugging accessible through 
 * "configure --enable-debug=yes" (-g and -DDEBUG compiler flags)
 * rewritten big parts of Makefile.in for the plugins

 * moved gui-independent functions into a library (libkwave)
 * rework of dialogs into single files and single plugins

   definitions. Threading is made a whole lot easier, because a only a 
   string has to be passed and gets expanded into the needed set of 
   parameters in each thread
 * io functions and playback adapted to SignalManager
 * Introduction of SignalManager class for multiple channel management

0.29.5 [1998-04]

 * Just a fix for an annoying bug while zooming out

0.29.4 [1998-03]

 * removed a memory leak in playback

0.29.3 [1998-02]

 * developement has slowed down a bit, this release is not as complete as I
   wished but since 0.29.2 has a destructor with parameters accidently left 
   in, and so does not compile on all systems -> here we go again...

 * reworked selection routines into a new class, code is still rather 
   confusing, but seems to work
 * added checkmark functionality again
 * converted file-menus to new menu-scheme
 * added gui to mix channels together, the needed functions for mixing 
   are still missing
 * Halt button by Gerhard Zintel

 * bug fix for saving selection.
 * save Block function added.
 * signal finding function in markers.cpp: gui improved.
 * some smaller bug fixes.
