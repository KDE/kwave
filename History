this Development Version

0.5.0-1 [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

moved my modifications from the Makefiles to Makefile.am

included targets "make release", "make patchlevel" and some scripts

(19991219) [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

remade my modifications of some Makefiles and of the configure script that
were lost during Martin's changes

changed shortcut for mixpaste from CTRL-SHIFT-X to CTRL-SHIFT-C

added the "crop" command to the edit menu

made the "mixpaste" command work

corrected the call of "delete", now really deletes instead of cutting
and copying the selection to the clipboard (saves clipboard content)

(19991218) [by mwilz@ernie.mi.uni-koeln.de]

changed filenames to reflect class names

one class per file is now the standard

stripped leading "Kwave" in Classnames for most Classes

(19991210) [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

removed -Werror compiler option (caused trouble with configure script)

fixed a nasty bug in SignalManager::save that caused crashes on
several positions in the program and libstdc++

(19991209) [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

gave the destructor of SignalManager some code, this fixes
a huge memory leak !

added a TODO file

added -Werror to the c++ compiler options when debuging enabled

some include file cleanups in libgui

(19991207) [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

SignalManager::writeWavChunk uses buffers for writing (much faster!)

bugfix: caption of main window changes after "SaveAs"

bugfix: selected resolution takes effect

bugfix: caption of main window changes after "SaveAs"

bugfix: SignalManager::writeWavChunk now doesn't destroy the signal's
data while saving

make distclean in the projekt root directory also removes zero-length
files, *.orig, *.rej and *~ (just makes cleaner than before)

symbolic links to Makefile, Makefile.in and Makefile.am in the plugins
directory are deleted with "make distclean" and rebuilt on "make"
(changes in the referenced Makefiles in the template directory will not be
reflected thousand times when creating a patch with diff)

cleanups, removed some old backup files

improved support for debugging accessible through 
"configure --enable-debug=yes" (-g and -DDEBUG compiler flags)

rewritten big parts of Makefile.in for the plugins

added -O2 compiler optimization

(19991203) [by Thomas.Eschenbacher@gmx.de]

merged with Martin Wilz's version

(11.99)

version numbering script donated by Thomas Eschenbacher

now using KTMainwindow for top level widgets

using timer to check message port -> alternative (threadsafe) message passing
instead of signal/slot

labelling code rewritten, now incompatible with old releases

batch loading routines

(10.99)

deleting channels works again

fixed savelabel dialog

corrected envelope dialog, string handling

connected many functions via the new string-based way of invocation

fixed some dependencies between old code and new classes (there's still more to do !)

saving should now work again

trimmed down Clipboard class

Color class as wrapper to QColor (may become independent later)

reworking Curve Class for creation via string, interpolation now uses curve objects

moved gui functions into a new library (libkwavegui)

new Classes: Parser DynamicLoader Filter (prevously was a struct)

moved gui-independent functions into a library (libkwave)

rework of dialogs into single files and single plugins

new calling scheme via string commands. this will allow scripting and macro
definitions. Threading is made a whole lot easier, because a only a string has
to be passed and gets expanded into the needed set of parameters in each thread

io functions and playback adapted to SignalManager

Introduction of SignalManager class for multiple channel management

Version 0.29.5 (4.98)

Just a fix for an annoying bug while zooming out

Version 0.29.4 (3.98)

removed a memory leak in playback

triple-checked the missing Accelerators in the Menumanager. it seems to be a
bug in qpopmenu, I'll wait for qt to be fixed, or until a workaround is known

recent Files are updated again, while the program is running

kwave now keeps track of last directory saved to; for user convenience

reestablished selection mechanism to match versions before 0.29.3 and corrected some otherwise screwed-up behaviour

_now_ all parameters to destructors should have vanished

Version 0.29.3 (2.98)

developement has slowed down a bit, this release is not as complete as i wished
but since 0.29.2 has a destructor with parameters accidently left in, and so
does not compile on all systems -> here we go again...

reworked selection routines into a new class, code is still rather confusing,
but seems to work

added checkmark functionality again

converted file-menus to new menu-scheme

added gui to mix channels together, the needed functions for mixing are still missing

Halt button by Gerhard Zint

Version 0.29.2

moved clipboard functionality to its own class

dynamic allocation of menu entries used by all classes but TopWidget

import of ascii data files

Version 0.29.1

Bugfix for multichannel save. Now the saved files should work with other prgs

local snap to peak by Gerhard Zintel

Version 0.29.0

changed version numbering and filename as suggested by Version 1.1 of "How To Name Things" from sunsite. The last digit will always mark be 0 for releases uploaded to ftp.kde.org.

added windowing (Hamming Hanning, Blackmann) functions

contribution from Gerhard Zintel displaying notes in fftview

Added pitch display window

implemented cursor and db scale for fft-view

added reselection and cursor change

added possibility of different display modes in Frequency representation

fixed severe quantisation bug in saving 16Bit routine, reported by 

mmaping support contributed by Juhana Kouhia

added as new Possibility to generate Signals: pulse trains

added wrapper for systems with no posixthreads -> still needs handling by configure script (change Makefile for not linking libpthread and doing a define)

First use of multiple threads (pthreads) in some functions

Pitch generation now independent of additive synthesis
added import function for ascii files

Ascii label saving now also by frequency

Label generation according to Period Detection (autocorellation)

Sonagram, FFTView and Distortion-Dialog  now use ScaleWidgets

New ScaleWidget gives the user more information 

Improved ProgressDialog and Interpolation class to allow multiple threads

fixed some minor bug fixes

Version 0.28 (July, 15  1998)

changes in curvewidget (recent point has another pixmap).
sorting of labels now works without overwriting of QGList::compareItems.
bug fix for saving selection.
save Block function added.
signal finding function in markers.cpp: gui improved.
some smaller bug fixes.

Version 0.27

first release, but never uploaded, because ftp.kde.org was down.
