Hi,

This is the kwave source distribution, a simple soundeditor for KDE.

Use kwave with care (save often, and to different files...), since it has not left ALPHA-State yet.

Since I didn't get the Makefiles right, it is necessary first to compile and install the libraries, then you can compile the binary and the plugins...

So step by step starting in the main distribution directory you do this:
./configure 
cd lib
make 
make install
cd ..
cd libgui
make 
make install
cd ..
make
make install

Requirements:

This distribution uses the standard template for a kde app, kexample.

Therefore you need autoconf-2.12 and automake-1.2 or higher, not to
mention the KDE-libs-Distribution and then the qt-lib 1.40...

Further requirements are glibc>2.07 for pthreads. Earlier versions of
libpthread (included in glibc) do not work with qt-lib (programm crashes at
start), don't know why, yet...
Not tested are libc5 with linuxthreads, if someone succeeds with this
combination please notify me !
(Note that linuxthreads has requirements for specific libc versions)

Good Luck, and if not, mail me about the bugs...
