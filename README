Hi,

This is the kwave source distribution. Kwave is a simple soundeditor for KDE.

Use kwave with care (save often and to different files...), since it has
not left ALPHA-State yet.

This distribution uses the standard template for a kde app, kexample.

Therefore you'll need the KDE-libs and qt-lib 1.40, probably also 
autoconf-2.12 and automake-1.2 or higher...

Further requirements are glibc>2.07 for pthreads. Earlier versions of
libpthread (included in glibc) do not work with qt-lib (programm crashes at
start), don't know why, yet...
Not tested are libc5 with linuxthreads, if someone succeeds with this
combination please notify me !
(Note that linuxthreads has requirements for specific libc versions)

It is also possible to build a non-threading version by removing the
#define THREADS in kwave/sample.h and leaving out -lpthread
in Makefile ! 

Then just run

>./configure
>make

Now you have to swap to superuser...

>make install

Good Luck, and if not, mail me the bugs...
