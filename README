Hello...

This is the kwave source distribution, a simple soundeditor for KDE.

Since this is an alpha version, don't expect to much ...

This distribution uses the standard template for a kde app, kexample.

Therefore you need autoconf-2.12 and automake-1.2 or higher, not to
mention the KDE-Distribution and then surely the qt-lib...

Just run

>./configure
>make depend
>make

Now you have to swap to superuser...

>make install

Good Luck, and if not, mail me the bugs...
