o bugfix: crash on "additive synthesis"

o some commands do not work: fft, averagefft, sonagram, options/menu,
  options/memory

o error handling in SignalWidget/Manager needs complete rework !

o at least show an error message if input file was invalid

o load and automatically repair files recorded with "arecord"

o range checking in SignalManager::getMaxMin()

o re-enable usage of memory mapped files

o bugfix: crash if a loaded file is not in RIFF format

o support for import/export of ASCII files with multiple channels

o Edit->Selection->"expand to beginning/end of file"

o add <project_root>/libgui/.libs to the -L parameter when making
  in src and plugins

o label handling doesn't work

o Segmentation fault after "Could not find labeltype"

o make use of the libX11 parameter --geometry

o the clipboard does not work between other kwave instances

o splitting of i18n for kwave, libgui and each plugin

o more complete i18n

o internationalization for other languages than german

o make the gui/redraws faster

o let more than one toplevel window work

o use the KDE's clipboard

o find the reason for that short noise at the end of playback
  (does not occur when the selected range ends with some silence !)

o if an incompatible version of libgui is installed, the linking of the
  kwave program fails during "make". Thus the libgui directory should be
  added to the linker's directory list (-L../libgui ?) during make of the
  kwave main program and the plugins

o apply the GNU coding style

o get the plugins working with compilers other than egcs

o playback in stereo

o fix bug in Fx->Periodic Silence (segmentation fault)

o pluginize/ put into library  the following files in src/ :
  mdialog_sweep.cpp mdialog_frequency.cpp mdialog_fixedfreq.cpp addsynth.h 

o context menu for right mouse button

o a nice toolbar

o icons for the buttons

o positioning the cursor to start/end of the file with Pos1 / End

o use the data types from sys/times.h instead of just "int"

o somewhere in far future: compile on architectures with a different
  size of int (not 32-bit), handle data in original data width
