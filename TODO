o inconsistence between drawing and mouse selection, probably a numeric
  problem, abt. +/-10 pixels difference (only x-axis)

o error on program shutdown: "QMenuData::removeItem: Index -1 out of range"

o add <project_root>/libgui/.libs to the -L parameter when making
  in src and plugins

o label handling doesn't work

o Segmentation fault after "Could not find labeltype"

o the clipboard does not work between other kwave instances

o splitting of i18n for kwave, libgui and each plugin

o more complete i18n

o internationalization for other languages than german

o make the gui/redraws faster

o let more than one toplevel window work

o use the KDE's clipboard

o find the reason for that short noise at the end of playback
  (does not occur when the selected range ends with some silence !)

o if an incompatible version of libgui is installed, the linking of the
  kwave program fails during "make". Thus the libgui directory should be
  added to the linker's directory list (-L../libgui ?) during make of the
  kwave main program and the plugins

o apply the GNU coding style

o get the plugins working with compilers other than egcs

o playback in stereo

o fix bug in Fx->Periodic Silence (segmentation fault)

o pluginize/ put into library  the following files in src/ :
  mdialog_sweep.cpp mdialog_frequency.cpp mdialog_fixedfreq.cpp addsynth.h
