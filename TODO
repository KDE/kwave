o playback only for selected channels

o resample signal before inserting into a signal with a different sample rate

o channel mixing dialog

o move label handling to class LabelManager

o make the SonagramWindow work

o find out how to get the "topdir" of rpm for "make rpm"

o Review playback code in SignalManager: null pointers, memory leaks, 
  thread handling?

o look at CurveWidget::CurveWidget()
o ProgressDialog::timedProgress()
o SignalWidget::appendLabel()
o ClipBoard::toWindow()
o SonagramWindow::toSignal()

o in CurveWidget: something goes wrong when mirroring to left

o re-enable the OverViewWidget: use signal/slot mechanism

o possible memory leaks due to controls/menus in CurveWidget, FFTWindow

o possible memory leak in MultiStateWidget: when do the images get released ?

o inspect the usage of ImageView: owner of the image? freeing the image?

o review all calls to DynamicLoader::getDialog, in: FFTWidget

o ClipBoard::appendChannel should append a _copy_ of the channel instead
  of the channel instead of itself (problem if channel gets deleted!)

o resizing of the TopWidget if channels have been added
  -> adjust minimum window size

o don't search for plugins and other files only in the global directory,
  use the .kde structure in the user's home directory too

o bugfix: crash on "additive synthesis"

o some commands do not work: fft, averagefft, sonagram, options/menu,
  options/memory, distort

o error handling in SignalWidget/Manager needs complete rework !

o load and automatically repair files recorded with "arecord"

o range checking in SignalManager::getMaxMin()

o use standard KDE accelerators (see KStdAccel)

o re-enable usage of memory mapped files

o make a menu group for @SELECTION

o remove all usages of KTopLevelWidget

o import of multi-channel ASCII files

o label handling doesn't work

o the clipboard does not work between other kwave instances

o splitting of i18n for kwave, libgui and each plugin

o more complete i18n

o internationalization for other languages than german

o use the KDE's clipboard

o support for KDE's session management

o find the reason for that short noise at the end of playback
  (does not occur when the selected range ends with some silence !)

o if an incompatible version of libgui is installed, the linking of the
  kwave program fails during "make". Thus the libgui directory should be
  added to the linker's directory list (-L../libgui ?) during make of the
  kwave main program and the plugins

o get the plugins working with compilers other than egcs

o playback in stereo

o fix bug in Fx->Periodic Silence (segmentation fault)

o pluginize/ put into library  the following files in src/ :
  mdialog_sweep.cpp mdialog_frequency.cpp mdialog_fixedfreq.cpp addsynth.h 

o context menu for right mouse button in SignalWidget

o a nice toolbar + icons for the buttons

o positioning the cursor to start/end of the file with Pos1 / End

o >>> COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF THE WHOLE API <<<

o globally use the data types from sys/times.h instead of just "int"

o somewhere in far future: compile on architectures with a different
  size of int (not 32-bit), handle data in original data width

o use some audio library, like libasound for import/export of other
  file formats

o plugins for import/export of different file formats (e.g. MP3)

o figure out how to work with exceptions:
  - works if ALL libraries use rtti and we compile with -frtti
  - does never work with --no-rtti
  - the program doesn't link under RedHat with -frtti
  => no rtti and no exceptions :-(
