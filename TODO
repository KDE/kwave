o make a proper projekt file for kdevelop (actually is broken)

o find the reason for that short noise at the end of playback
  (does not occur when the selected range ends with some silence !)

o if an incompatible version of libgui is installed, the linking of the
  kwave program fails during "make". Thus the libgui directory should be
  added to the linker's directory list (-L../libgui ?) during make of the
  kwave main program and the plugins

o find the reason for the warnings about multiple definitions of
  QString when linking (libqt-1.4, seems to disappear with libqt-2)

o apply the GNU coding style

o change selected bits_per_sample menu entry after loading a wav file

o bugfix for saving list of recent files

o get the plugins working with compilers other than egcs

o playback in stereo

o disable Save and SaveAs menu entries if no signal is present

o check dependencies/Makefiles

o fix bug in Fx->Periodic Silence (segmentation fault)

o take a look at CORBA

o pluginize/ put into library  the following files in src/ :
  mdialog_sweep.cpp mdialog_frequency.cpp mdialog_fixedfreq.cpp addsynth.h
