o collapse/expand of track views

o add views with meta data

o auto-detect song borders set markers, for splitting recorded stuff into several
  parts and then save them to disc as separate files

o detect song titles / metadata by using musicbrainz

o add some "did you know..." dialog to the application startup, to inform
  the user about news (like MDI GUI) or tips and tricks

o proper channel mixing matrix for well-known track numbers and file formats
  (e.g. wav or vorbis)

o support for other (faster) sample rate converters

o support for Vorbis Chapter Extension <=> map to Kwave labels
  see http://wiki.xiph.org/VorbisComment

o Ogg/Vorbis: support > 2 channels or downmixing

o FLAC in Ogg container

o SPEEX in Ogg container

o ALAC support (via libaudiofile)

o codec_wav: disable workaround for fact chunk == 0 as soon as a newer
  version of libaudiofile is available which can handle this

o new plugin: "anti clipping"

o use noise shaping globally in sample2float()

o support for "raw" import/export

o record plugin: implement amplify, AGC, fade in, fade out

o file import from non-local URLs (e.g. fish://...)

o file export to non-local URLs (e.g. fish://...)

o find a way to add a "Help" button to the saveblocks dialog

o move label with mouse (drag&drop)

o new import/export plugin using ffmpeg/libavcodec

o more intelligent clipping of position widget

o show sonagram as "signal view" below each track or below the whole signal

o support for multi selection

o debug aid: new plugin for adding a new track with test/debug info:
  - stripe number
  - hull curve
  - test pattern: sample offset within stripe
  - test pattern: stripe borders

o use xml description for device names in playback/record plugins

o use svg graphics instead of pixmaps

o INF_COMMENTS cannot be modified per FileInfoDialog

o INF_PERFORMER cannot be modified per FileInfoDialog

o use LADSPA

o JACK audio support

o maybe some effects from soundtouch

o use some xml file for the menu instead of a macro

o support for Speex codec: http://www.speex.org/

o ALSA record/playback: also detect devices configured in the .asoundrc,
  and not only hardware devices

o find a better solution for deadlock when closing the current file while
  a plugin is still running, instead of refusing the request to close

o more precise handling of the playback pointer
  -> latency handling

o dithering/noise shaping when loading/saving

o open file dialog: add a preview widget that shows info about the file
  and maybe has "playback/pause/stop" buttons

o adjustable playback speed (similar to what vlcplayer offers)
  -> look how noatun does that...

o support for compressed wav files, like those found on www.montypython.net
  -> MPEG 3 is still not supported by libaudiofile

o TrackPixmap: implement usage of "extra_samples" for interpolated mode

o fileinfo plugin: auto-generate filename from "track - title"

o use a MenuManager in the plugins (e.g. sonagram)

o optimized cut/paste, at zero-crossing

o speed up MP3 import by blockwise operation -> use Kwave::SampleBuffer

o import/export of labels as meta info in codecs other than wav

o SonagramWindow::toSignal()

o new plugin: amplifyclip [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: pulse train [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: additive synthesis [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: fft, averagefft [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: distort [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: channel mixer [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: delay [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: flip [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: quantize [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: sweep [porting from v0.6.4]

o new plugin: Fx->Periodic Silence [porting from v0.6.4]

o support for KDE's session management

o macro recorder

o change coding style / tabs -> spaces
  -> should be done in context of migration to next KDE framework

o user selectable color scheme
  (feature requested by John David Thompson, 2006-12-20)

o re-evaluate use of taglib as alternative to id3lib

o port from id3lib to taglib
  => rejected, currently no alternative available
  => taglib currently works only on files, unsuitable API
     + inaccurate file length detection (units of 1 sec)
  => libid3tag is nearly as old, undocumented and would
      produce a lot of work

o switch to use float as sample_t (requires much work...)
  -> version 0.9.x

o about plugin: auto-scroll for contents

o re-run cmake automatically when VERSION file has changed

o EBN: re-enable qclasses check when it is maintained again

o license change to GPL v3 ?

o support for visualization plugins (svn rev 2498) => DROPPED
  - new functions
    * allow drag&drop to reorder signal views
    * resizing of signal views per size grip
    * allow plugins to add and remove own signal views
  - enhanced functions (maybe never...)
    * store order and settings of signal views in embedded metadata
    * store order and settings of signal views in a separate file
    * provide global database for colors (for signal, labels, etc.)
    * reordering of tracks according to order of the views
    * context sensitive toolbar/menu entries when clicking to a view
    * navigating between views per <Tab> key
