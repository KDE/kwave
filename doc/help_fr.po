"&kapp; does not need support for any special sound card. The sound card only "
"has to be supported by your operating system and &kapp; uses it's interface "
"to the operating system's sound driver through a standard interface. So "
"&kapp; can play on any sound card that KDE is able to play on."

"This is just because we decided that those actions are not working stable "

"Why does &kapp; consume more memory than it can be expected from the size of "

msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:2662
msgid ""
"The reason for this is that &kapp; internally stores all samples in 32-bit "
"integers. This was easy to program, made the application faster and a bit "
"more reliable. So if you load an 8-bit file with about one megabyte it will "
"consume about four megabytes. Maybe we will change this somewhere in the "
"future..."
