Sorry no Documentation yet. If you feel the need for it, write me a note if you want to contribute and I will provide information, in the case you should need it.</p>

<P>Kwave is written by <A HREF="mailto:mwilz@ernie.mi.uni-koeln.de.de">Martin Wilz</A>.
The code incorporates a part of another work: the FFT-Routines by
the GNU Scientific Library project.<b>
Also parts of KEdit were and will be used as guideline for implementation
of specific KDE features. </P>
