Hi,

This is the kwave library 0.3

This library evolved from the parts the kwave project, that should not be
bound to a specific gui library. Currently there is a dependency to libqt, 
but this problem should be feasible soon... (only qcolor/qlist is being used)

The library provides the following classes/services:

a discrete Time Signal Container Class with runtime linking modules (plugins)

some general purpose functions (window function generator, interpolation, parser for strings, file loading & label class)

A part (the fft routines )of the gsl 0.3 (Gnu Scientific Library) is used in
this library. As the library will become more wide-spread, this will vanish
and replaced by the  original shared libraries. Fast conversion is not that
easy to do since the api of gsl has changed a bit lately.

Installation:

Try the following commands:

./configure 
make
(change to superuser)
make install
ldconfig       (if it's not in path, you'll probably find it in /sbin/)



Requirements
------------

You'll need qt-lib 1.40 and probably autoconf/automake 

Further requirements are glibc>2.07 for pthreads. Earlier versions of
libpthread (included in glibc) do not work with qt-lib (programm crashes at
start), don't know why, yet...
Not tested are libc5 with linuxthreads, if someone succeeds with this
combination please contact me!
(Note that linuxthreads has requirements for specific libc versions)

Good Luck, and if not, mail me about the bugs...
(send bug reports to kwave-list@fs.spinfo.uni-koeln.de)
